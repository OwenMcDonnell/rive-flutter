# Rive Flutter

![Rive hero image](https://cdn.rive.app/rive_logo_dark_bg.png)

Rive Flutter is a runtime library for [Rive](https://rive.app), a real-time interactive design and animation tool.

This library allows you to fully control Rive files with a high-level API for simple interactions and animations, as well as a low-level API for creating custom render loops for multiple artboards, animations, and state machines in a single canvas.

## Overview of Rive

[Rive](https://rive.app) is a powerful tool that helps teams create and run interactive animations for apps, games, and websites. Designers and developers can use the collaborative editor to create motion graphics that respond to different states and user inputs, and then use the lightweight open-source runtime libraries, like Rive Flutter, to load their animations into their projects.

### Note on the Impeller renderer

Starting in Flutter v3.10, [Impeller](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller) has replaced [Skia](https://skia.org/) to become the default renderer for apps on the iOS platform and may continue to be the default on future platforms over time. As such, there is a possibility of rendering and [performance discrepancies](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/134432) when using the Rive Flutter runtime with platforms that use the Impeller renderer that may not have surfaced before. If you encounter any visual or performance errors at runtime compared to expected behavior in the Rive editor, we recommend trying the following steps to triage:

1. Try running the Flutter app with the `--no-enable-impeller` flag to use the Skia renderer. If the visual discrepancy does not show when using Skia, it may be a rendering bug on Impeller. However, before raising a bug with the Flutter team, try the second point belowðŸ‘‡
```bash
flutter run --no-enable-impeller
```
2. Try running the Flutter app on the latest master channel. It is possible that visual bugs may be resolved on the latest Flutter commits, but not yet released in the beta or stable channel.
3. If you are still seeing visual discrepancies with just the Impeller renderer on the latest master branch, we recommend raising a detailed issue to the [Flutter Github repo](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) with a reproducible example, and other relevant details that can help the team debug any possible issues that may be present.

## Supported platforms

Be sure to read the [platform specific considerations](platform_considerations.md) for the Rive Flutter package.
